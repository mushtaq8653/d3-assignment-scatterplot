AI Usage Statement

This project used ChatGPT (OpenAI) as a support tool for small and limited tasks, similar to consulting documentation or StackOverflow. 
AI assistance was restricted to:

-Clarifying D3.js concepts such as scales, axes, and tooltips
-Helping debug minor errors in the JavaScript code
-Suggesting improvements for zoom/pan behavior and trend-line logic
-Providing guidance on how to structure the README and documentation

What the student implemented manually

The core implementation of the project was completed manually, including:

-Selecting the dataset, variables, and visual encodings
-Writing the full D3 chart setup (SVG creation, scales, axes, circles)
-Implementing interactive features such as hover, zoom, pan, and transitions
-Loading, transforming, and cleaning the dataset manually
-Structuring the project files (HTML, CSS, JS)
-Testing, debugging, and refining the final visualization
-Preparing the deployment, screenshot, and final submission artifacts
